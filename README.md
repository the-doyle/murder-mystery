I created this app for a highly elaborate murder mystery game I designed and wrote from scratch. This was the second game I've planned and this time I created an app for it. 

The app allowed players to manage in-game items they would find or otherwise acquire, including weapons, diversions, and room keys. It was a simple CRUD app but really helped make the party awesome. 

You might enjoy looking over some of the resources I created for the game (puzzles, characters, maps, etc) here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xlO7R81hIw8X2er-QE6sUzg5suZ1NGMu?usp=sharing

You won't be able to sign in to use the app unfortunately, but feel free to look over the code. It is a bit sloppy, this was my first Next.js app.
